## Model Architecture

- **5 Convolutional Blocks**: Each block consists of Conv2D layers with ReLU activation, followed by MaxPooling.
- **3 Fully Connected Layers**: These layers process the extracted features for classification into 100 classes.

## Training Details

- **Dataset**: CIFAR-100
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss
- **Epochs**: 10
